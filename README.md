# Soundtrack-Generation-From-Posters

The aim of our project is to, first, predict the genre of a movie poster, then, produce a suitable soundtrack for the predicted genre. A machine learning pipeline is used which consists of two machine learning models. The first model takes a movie poster image as an input and gives its predicted genre. This output is the input of the second model which is for producing a soundtrack. Consequently, the predicted soundtrack depicts a prediction of movie posterâ€™s soundtrack according to its genre.
